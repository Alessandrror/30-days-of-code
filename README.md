# [30 days of code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)

## Introduction

The `30 days of code` is a popular trending in the programming and development world. The main idea is simple: <b>code for 30 days</b>.

In this case, I will use the challenges provided by [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and try to complete each challenge in a few languages ​​that I want to practice.

I'll push a solution for a challenge in one programming language every day... or so I hope!

## Languages

I chose the languages ​​according to my preferences, so the order to follow the path is:

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [C++](https://cplusplus.com/)
<!-- - [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) -->
<!-- - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) -->
<!-- - [Java](https://www.java.com/) -->
<!-- - [C](https://www.learn-c.org/) -->

And yes, it depends on my time and if I don't die on the way to achieving it, I will consider adding other languages ​​to practice and understand the syntax.
